        <p className='artist-description'> There’s no rulebook for pop, that’s the beauty of it. At it’s heart 
                                    is a universality and freedom that makes it all so joyous. Someone 
                                    who understands that better than anyone is Danish pop polymath 
                                    Karen Marie Ørsted, aka MØ, aka the world’s best pop star. Having 
established herself with the raw, DIY-tinged agit-pop of 2014’s 
hugely influential debut album No Mythologies To Follow, she’s 
since expanded her sound and artistic vision via collaboration 
with a broad spectrum of some of music’s most interesting 
characters – from Diplo to Charli XCX to Cashmere Cat to SOPHIE. 
In 2015 she co-wrote and sang on one of the most streamed songs 
of all time in the shape of Major Lazer’s global smash, Lean On 
(she’d later repeat the trick with their 2016 Justin Bieber 
collaboration, Cold Water, a UK number 1), while these features 
have been peppered with hits of her own, most notably last year’s 
MNEK-produced Final Song, which broke the UK Top 15 and was a huge 
hit across Europe and Australia, and garnered MØ’s first Gold 
record in the US as a solo artist. As work continues on her 
second album, due in 2018, she’s unveiled a surprise six-track 
EP, When I Was Young, which aims to complete the circle that 
started with No Mythologies To Follow and hints at where she’s 
headed next. “Putting out this EP is just something I’ve wanted 
to do for a long time, and I just felt it was right to put these 
songs out before I put out the album,” she says. “I’m a super 
nostalgic person and so these songs, and the meanings behind them, 
all fit into this personal journey I’ve been on.”

To be fair it’s been quite the journey. Growing up in the sleepy 
village of Ejlstrup to a psychologist father and teacher mother, 
Ørsted always knew she wanted to sidestep academia and be creative. 
Her musical idols were typically polarised, with the Spice Girls 
dominating her pre-teen years before Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon 
took over as number one when she was a teenager. Early musical 
projects leant towards aggressive punk statements, with titles 
like A Piece of Music To Fuck To and Pussy in Your Face, before 
she started collaborating with Danish producer Ronni Vindahl in 
2012 under the moniker MØ (Danish for virgin, by the way). From 
there the seeds of No Mythologies To Follow were sewn via the 
critically-adored early singles Glass, Pilgrim and Waste Of Time. 
After the album was released in March 2014, preceded by the 
Diplo-produced XXX 88, MØ launched into tour mode, traversing the 
globe and meeting a host of new friends and collaborators.

That year saw her collaborate with Swedish rapper Elliphant on 
the Joel Little-produced One More and then, in 2015, everything 
went interstellar. Having been asked by Diplo to write some 
lyrics over a beat he’d made for his Major Lazer project, MØ 
came up with Lean On, singing the song initially meant for Rihanna 
with such conviction she knew it could only be released with her 
voice on it. And it was. Over 1 billion (!) streams later and it’s 
now one of the biggest, most recognised songs of the last decade. 
Its success was swift and sudden, but the aftermath has been a 
little more prolonged. “It was a fantastic thing, but this is 
the first year where I can focus more on my own project,” she 
says. Lean On’s success brought with it more opportunities, 
including another collaboration with Major Lazer on Cold Water, 
9 (After Coachella) with producer Cashmere Cat, Don’t Leave 
with UK producers Snakehips and an appearance on fellow pop 
rebel Charli XCX’s Number 1 Angel mixtape. “It’s great that 
there aren’t as many rules as to what you’re supposed to do 
now,” she says of her varied few years.

Which brings us to When I Was Young. Having released individual, 
almost standalone tracks for the last few years, this EP 
represents a proper body of work, covering songs written 
between 2014 and 2017 that pinpoint different moments in MØ’s 
career so far. “Making the EP has been such a nice flashback 
experience because I forgot about the little things; how you 
put the songs together, the lyrics, the song titles and the 
artwork,” she explains. “Just being in the bubble of that 
energy is so fucking awesome. It’s so amazing to be able to 
create a universe.” It’s a universe that opens with the gently 
pulsating Roots, a sonic throwback to No Mythologies to Follow 
that was actually written a month before that album came out 
and was musically inspired by an unfinished song she’d made as 
part of a trip-hop band in 2011. “I remember when I wrote that 
song in February 2014 I said to myself ‘this is going to be the 
first song from my new album’, and I know this isn’t my second 
album but in a way it felt so right,” she explains. Like the 
EP as whole it was executive produced by fellow Dane Vasco, 
who offered a unifying sound to the six tracks. Roots’ slow-burn 
build is in contrast to the title track’s cabaret-esque feel, 
the delicious horn breakdown drawing out the song’s playful 
nostalgia (“and the holidays went on and on”). “We tried a lot 
of different things for that instrumental break, but that was 
what the song called for,” she laughs of its unexpected exuberance.

More sombre is Turn My Heart To Stone, which again utilises brass 
but to create a sadder sonic soundscape. It also showcases MØ’s 
upper register on the melancholic chorus which flutters elegantly 
over popping beats. The EP’s connection to MØ’s more recent output 
– created with the likes of Benny Blanco, Ryan Tedder and Noonie 
Bao – is the vibrant dance-pop of Linking With You, which reflects 
the EP’s experimental practices in more ways than one. “That one 
was done with a UK producer called FTSE,” she says. “It was started 
by a group of songwriters I know who then forwarded it to me and I 
re-worked the lyrics so they properly fit into my world. I’ve never 
really done a song like that before.” Either way, whoever came up 
with the line “I can’t come out to play, I’ll be on my phone all 
day, scrolling all my time away” deserves a medal. Another older 
one is the clanking electronica of BB, which was written in late 
2014. “I had just started seeing someone and I was so in love with 
him and scared he was going to leave me, so I did this song as a 
tribute to if he left me. But I’m still with him so it’s fine,” 
she laughs. Closing the EP is the beautiful Runaway which sounds 
like one of the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s quieter moments and was inspired 
by a short film her childhood best friend was making (incidentally 
it’s the same friend who also inspired recent single Night With 
You, a collaboration with Benny Blanco, Cashmere Cat and SOPHIE). 
“It’s really personal to me because it reminds me of my best 
friend and our childhood,” she says of Runaway. “It made sense 
for it to close the EP, with me daydreaming about my childhood 
and trying to figure things out.”

In a way that’s what When I Was Young represents. It’s an EP 
that needed to be made in order to move on from that first album 
and the “Lean On bubble” as she calls it, but it’s also a fully 
realised body of work in and of itself. “These years have been a 
learning process about what’s important, and that’s what this EP 
reflects,” she says. “These songs were chosen instinctively, and 
by a gut feeling really, but they’re all about both looking back 
and forward.” The future is very exciting indeed.</p>
